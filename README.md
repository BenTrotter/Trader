<!-- When defining hyperparameters, as you increase the weighting of a returns based metric in multi-objective analysis vs. a risk based metric, it becomes more important to use stop loss / take profit to manage risk -->

# Tighter ATR range tends to perform better with higher weighting towards return based metrics
